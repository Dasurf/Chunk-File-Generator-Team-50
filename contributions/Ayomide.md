I was the Lead designer for team 50 and was in charge of the overall visual direction and UX process that was undertaken in the project phase; giving guides to team members and making sure we followed the goal of the project i.e. making the interface user-friendly, easy to navigate and also users being able to split their files into JSON and CSV and other features like converting, merging and also access to their files/save for later feature. 
Some of the individual contributions were:
First, was the Research, I encouraged team members to check other websites i.e. create a competitive analysis and document it to get inspiration to see how we can make our product better, @faith and @vincent anchored this process. This was also in line with making foundational research which was anchored by @samuel and @olamide, they came up with the empathy mapping, user personas, story board etc.

Second, Style guide, I was in charge of the style guide, creating button in states, selecting icons and making them components, the typography styles and other functional components, making sure they were consistent with the brand, this process made our work effective and helped us to churn works faster. @faith helped to create the brand logo and picked the color that was eventually used as styles.
