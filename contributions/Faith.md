I worked with Vincent on the competitors' analysis for secondary research in the UX process https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OMarqGVEyEQmLQ48RZ9lLSpkZsGrd6v25UqfgSWQ4A/edit?usp=drivesdk

I contributed to the style guide which was anchored by @Asiru by creating the logo and color styles used in the project. https://www.figma.com/file/RH1nJ2LaKUYYayO9TjcUIg/Team-50-Chunk-Files-(Copy)?node-id=22%3A2

I brainstormed with @Asiru, @Olamide, and @Lois, on the UX process of the features/tools screens, and I designed the UI from these informed knowledge, starting with the Split CSV page, https://www.figma.com/file/RH1nJ2LaKUYYayO9TjcUIg/Team-50-Chunk-Files-(Copy)?node-id=431%3A149
